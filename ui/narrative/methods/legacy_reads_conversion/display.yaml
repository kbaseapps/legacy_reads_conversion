    Convert legacy read library objects types to new read library object types
    The legacy read libraries are objects of type KBaseAssembly.SingleEndReads and KBaseAssembly.PairedEndReads.
    The new way of storing read libraries are objects of type KBaseFiles.SingleEndReads and KBaseFiles.PairedEndReads. 
    This App provides users a way to convert from legacy object types to new object types.
