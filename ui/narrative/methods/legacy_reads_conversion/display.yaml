name     : Convert Legacy Reads to new Reads type 
tooltip  : |
    The legacy reads include objects of type KBaseAssembly.SingleEndReads and KBaseAssembly.PairedEndReads.
    These types have been updated to KBaseFiles.SingleEndReads and KBaseFiles.PairedEndReads respectively.
    This App provides users a way to convert from legacy object types to new object types.
